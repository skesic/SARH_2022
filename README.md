Data on civilian search and rescue helicopter activity in the United Kingdom, produced by Department for Transport. 
This release covers civilian search and rescue helicopter (SARH) operations in the UK. The data originates from the Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre (ARCC) which is responsible for the coordination of search       and rescue (SAR) helicopters and is provided to the Department for Transport (DfT) by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).

Statistics on the civilian search and rescue helicopter (SARH) taskings for the UK, with breakdowns by tasking type, location type (land, maritime, or coast), and helicopter base, throughout the April 2015 to March

 ## Tools
  For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
  - pandas - for data analysis
  - NumPy - for mathematical operations
  - os - for interacting with operating system
  - matplotlib.pyplot - for plotting
  - seaborn - for visualizations
  - scipy - for visualizations
  - statsmodels.api - Using .api imports the public access version of statsmodels, which is a library that handles statistical models.
  - warnings - This is a library that handles warnings.

  
  ## Excuting the code
  The code is available as jupyter notebooks, available under (scripts).
  To launch the notebook, open terminal and run the command:
  - importing data: jupyter notebook importData.ipynb
